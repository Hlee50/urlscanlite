# URL Scan Lite

This project is a lite, minimalistic version of [urlscan.io](https://urlscan.io/).

The web app itself is an API wrapper and client of urlscan.io's API featuring a custom frontend built with React and Typescript. The UI has been redesigned for a cleaner, more modern look, making scan results simple and intuitive to view, displaying only the most relevant information for the average user.


## Accessing and using the app
- https://urlscanlite.vercel.app/

Like urlscan.io, scans can be submitted as public, unlisted, or private using the options menu.
